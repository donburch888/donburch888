- 👋 Hi, I’m @donburch888, or just Don
- 👀 I’m interested in ... science fiction, space, robotics, Home Assistant and Rhasspy Voice Assistant
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... it feels like everyting ! So many learning curves, like climbing Mt. Everest.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Rhasspy user documentation
- 📫 How to reach me ... my email is donburch888 at hotmail.com

I worked as a computer programmer on commercial applications for over 30 years, most of it using versions of BASIC and Windows. 
I have gradually migrated to FOSS - first using excellent applications (MySQL, OpenOffice, GIMP) that migrated to Windows environment; then switched to Ubuntu OS; and lately with Home Assistant. 

I understand that FOSS projects are individuals putting their time and effort into producing something for themself to use, then making it available for anyone else to use, and if they're lucky other individuals will get involved and contribute. 
Contributors are focussed on adding the next feature, for their own use or interest - not on doing things for those users who don't contribute.  They may provide hints and pointers, but don't waste their time writing user-level documentation or responding to noobs asking for someone else to do all the work for them.  I get this.

But we do not all have the skills, background or aptitude to become developers and understand cryptic hints.  Good user-level documentation helps bring new users up to a standard where they becomea able to help themselves (and the rest of us).  Being asked the same question several times shows where the gaps in understanding are, where better documentation is required.
